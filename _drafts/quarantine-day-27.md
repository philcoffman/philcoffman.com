I've been telling myself to journal more. Even though I value journalling and respect those who steadily practice it, I've always found it hard to form the habit for myself. But I don't want to give up. In fact, I've been inspired to keep at it after reading [Jonnie's recent posts](https://destroytoday.com/blog "DestroyToday Blog") as well as the others coming through the RSS feeds I've been collecting and consuming. So I'm making an effort to contribute by sharing what's happening in our little corner of the quarantined world.

The kids have settled well into homeschooling. It's a mix of self-paced work and tasks which need our guidance. The school has them on Microsoft Teams where they distribute a daily work schedule and manage assignments as well as Zoom for teacher "office hour" chats and classmate "recesses". From 9â€“12 they focus on school. The rest of the day is split up into outdoor activities (the boys have started to build a fort), group activities like games/puzzles and some technology time (the new Xbox One is a hit). 

My wife Cynthia and I fit in work hours when we can. She helps with accounting tasks for our church and gets most of those done at home, though one day a week she goes into the office to take care of needs which can only be processed on site.
