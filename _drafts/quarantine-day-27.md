I've been telling myself to journal more. Even though I value journalling and respect those who steadily practice it, I've always found it hard to form the habit for myself. But I don't want to give up. In fact, I've been inspired to keep at it after reading [Jonnie's recent posts](https://destroytoday.com/blog "DestroyToday Blog") as well as the others coming through the RSS feeds I've been collecting and consuming. So I'm making an effort to contribute by sharing what's happening in our little corner of the quarantined world.
