Next week I'll be heading to San Francisco to attend Figma's [Config](https://config.figma.com/ "Config") conference. I'm fairly new to Figma, but the time I've spent in the app has me very curious about its possibilities and future. I'm looking forward to hearing about how other creatives use it, learning from their workflows, and making new connections. Plus, I get some quality in-person time with my good friend [Noah Stokes](https://twitter.com/motherfuton "Noah Stokes on Twitter") who I haven't seen in over two years. If you see me there come up and say hello!
