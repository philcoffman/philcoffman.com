I've been an avid podcast listener for years. I listen to shows centered on technology, film, interviews, and design (to name a few) and one of my favorite creative-centric podcasts is [The Collective Podcast](https://www.thecollectivepodcast.com/ "The Collective Podcast") by the multi-talented [Ash Thorp](https://twitter.com/ashthorp "Ash Thorp - Twitter"). Ash hosts discussions with a wide range of designers, illustrators, film-makers, visual effects artists, writers, painters, programmers, etc. What I enjoy most is when Ash and his guest(s) discuss their processes. Ash loves to dig into what drives people to create, where they find inspiration, how they develop their unique voice, the struggles that come with the never-ending drumbeat of software innovation and pressures of living in a social-media heavy world, and so on. No matter who he speaks with I often find solace in hearing other creatives struggling with the same things I do and I regularly end an episode inspired to continue to create and not just consume.

One episode I recently finished and particularly resonated with me is the one he did with [Victor Bonafonte](https://www.artstation.com/vbonafonte "Victor Bonafonte - Artstation"), CEO and Art Director at [Beauty and the Bit](https://www.beautyandthebit.com/ "Beauty and the Bit") based in Spain.
