[This oral history by ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/allstar2014/story/_/page/dunk-2000/oral-history-2000-nba-slam-dunk-contest "Rise of Vinsanity: The story of the 2000 dunk contest") of the 2000 dunk contest and the rise of Vinsanity is well worth your time. I remember watching it on TV. The hype around Vince Carter was real. The man could flat-out jump and hearing the backstory of the dunks he performed was a joy to consume. Hard to believe he's still playing in the NBA to this day.
