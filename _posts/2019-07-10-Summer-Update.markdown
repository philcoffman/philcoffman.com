Things have been a little quiet here on site, but not so in life. Since the [launch of CyclingBuilder](https://cyclingbuilder.com/) I've had my hands full with [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com), updates to the responsive templates, and working on a Dark Mode for both sites. I also took a month off and spent the first half of the summer in Europe. I have photos and thoughts to share on our time there which I will write about soon. More to do, more to come.
