Apparat's new album ["LP5"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/lp5/1450153254) came out last Friday. The second track, "Dawan", was released a few weeks ago and I've been listening to it in eager anticipation of the full album. Apparat's music, and even more so his collaboration as "Moderat" with the Modeselektor crew, is a regular go-to for me when selecting music to work to. Deep and rhythmic with just the right amount of dancey goodness.
