When I walked out of the theater after seeing "Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse" I was dumbfounded into how they did the animation. I have a decent understanding for how movie effects are made, but I was at a loss for words on this film. Since then I've been anxious to learn more about how the creators achieved the results. This video from WIRED peels back the curtain to shed some light on the techniques and tricks used to bring the characters and world to life.

There are so many great nuggets of information in this video. Here are a few of my favorites:
- To take what is special about the art quality and style of comics and transfer it to the screen the team did away anything soft or that which did not belong in the illustrated world, like motion blur and camera focus.
- You can pause the movie at any point and the frame looks like a crisp illustration. ðŸ™€
- Many of the animated background elements are just blobs of color and light, which saved a lot of time for the animators without sacrificing detail.
- The effects team came up with a genius method of blending 3D character animation with traditional line work to help enhance and punctuate the emotions and performances of the characters. Machine-learning was even used to speed up this process while maintaining the precision and intentionality of each placed line.

Another great behind-the-scenes resource I enjoyed about S:ITSV is [Ep. 197 of The Collective Podcast with Patrick O'Keefe](https://www.thecollectivepodcast.com/episodes/197-patrick-okeefe) who was an art director on the film. Give that one a listen too.
