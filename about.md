I'm a designer living in Austin, TX currently in the Design Lead role at [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/). My primary creative areas include web design, interface layout and design, and overall art direction. I'm also actively improving my understanding of motion graphics and 3D whenever I get the chance. I used to draw back before computers were cool. I aspire to get back into it in my downtime using Procreate on the iPad Pro.

I've been married to the love of my life for over 15 years and we get to parent and raise three awesome kids. While design is a big part of my life and will forever be a passion of mine, my family, friends, and faith are the true foundations of my life.
